1. Initialise a git repo and push the code onto the git
Reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-push-local-branch-to-remote-how-to-publish-a-new-branch-in-git/
git init
git branch -m master main
git add .
git commit -m "episode-01"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ankitadk/Namaste-React.git
git remote -v
git pull origin main
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
git status

2. Install npm
npm init

3. Install Parcel - it is a bundler
npm install -D parcel => install parcel as a dev dependency since not needed on production
npx parcel index.html
Error
deleted node_modules folder and reinstalled npm using below command
npm install
npx parcel index.html => creates a dev build and hosts our app onto the local server [link: http://localhost:1234]

npm=> install a package
npx=> execute a package

Using cdn links is not a good way to use react library in our project.
Bcoz network calls are very costly. 
We can easily use it if it is already present in our node_modules and we do not wish to make any network calls.
We need to change cdn links if we need to use the upgraded version of the library.

4. Intsall react in our project
npm install react
npm i react-dom

Parcel:
-created a dev build
-created a local server
-it does HMR => hot module replacement since it uses File Watching Algorith (written in c++)
-it does caching for faster builds
-it does image optimization - most expensive work for a browser is loading images
-in case of production build it does the file minification
-bundling
-file compression so that the size is reduced
-consistent hashing
-code splitting
-differential bundling - to support older browsers
-Error handling
-HTTPs
-Tree Shaking - removes unused code

5. creating a production ready app using parcel
npx parcel build index.html

6. add browser compatibility in package.json file
  "browserslist": [
    "last 2 versions"
  ]
  
7. add scripts to package.json to create a dev and prod build
"start": "parcel index.html",
"build": "parcel build index.html",

npm run start => create dev build
npm start => short cut to create dev build
npm run build => create production build
